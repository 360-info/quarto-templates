# 360-dashembed format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template 360-info/quarto-templates/360-dashembed
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your embed.

## Metadata

This template comes with supplementary files in the `_popups` folder. These generally don't need to be edited manually: customise the metadata under `360embed` in the main Quarto document, and the contents will be combined back in on render.
